# Most Important Asset In A Software Organization
1. people
	- costs a lot to recruit and retain good people
2. people management
	- people are respected and assigned responsibilities that reflect their skills and experience
3. critical factors in people management
	- consistency - treated in a comparable way
	- respect - different skills that should be respected
	- inclusion - listened to, all views are considered
	- honesty - about what is going well and not so well

# The Guerrilla Guide To Interviewing By Joel Spolsky
- Consider the problem where you have 2 programmers and need to deliver an AlphaZero chess engine from scratch in 7 days.
- Can your team do it?
	- Will your team be able to use UML-generating tools?
		- not important, can be learned
	- Will we have 19-inch monitors? Will we have access to all the coffee we can drink?
		- not important
- keys for team formation
	- hire **smart** people who can **get things done**

# Group Working
- most software engineering is a group activity
	- the development schedule for most non-trivial software projects is such that they cannot be completed by one person working alone
- group interaction is a key determinant of group performance
- flexibility in group composition is limited
	- managers must do the best they can with available people

# Factors Influencing Team Working
- group composition
	- task-oriented, self-oriented, interaction-oriented
- group cohesiveness
	- group quality standards, work closely together, learn from each other, egoless programming
- group communications
	- essential for effective work, promotes understanding
- group organization
	- relatively small sizes (< 8 members), big projects split into multiple small projects

# Coping With Hitchhikers and Couch Potatoes On Teams
- paper by Professor Barbara Oakley from Oakland University
- Consider the scenario where there are four team members: you, Mary, Henry, and Jack
- Jack is too busy to meet, turns in junk, never answers phone or email, doesn't show up for meetings, has subliminal writing skills, complains about everything.
- you, Mary, and Henry, are problems because they let Jack get away with his problems.
- Professor Distracted says:
	- this is a dysfunctional team
	- everyone is at fault (Jack least of all)
	- Jack gets good grades without doing quality work

- What the group did wrong?
	- absorbing
		- group took pride in getting the job done anyways
	- hitchhikers count on you acting in a self-sacrificing manner
	- by not reflecting the consequences of the hitchhiker's behavior - you are rewarding them
- What the group should have done?
	- mirroring
		- reflect the consequences of the behavior so that the hitchhiker pays the price, not you
	- maintain your sense of reality
	- show by your actions that you have a bottom line - there are limits to the type of behavior you will and will not accept
- Specific Actions The Group Should Have Taken
	- too busy to meet -> find the time
	- body language
	- shoddy work is unacceptable
	- don't waste time trying to contact him
	- don't put his name down
	- stick to your guns!
- Only Jack can change Jack
	- He has no incentive to change if you do all his work for him.
	- You can only change your attitude so that Jack no longer takes advantage of you.
	- People like Jack can be master manipulators.
	- Stop allowing these dysfunctional patterns early in the game.
- But what about Henry.
	- handling couch potatoes is a piece of cake compared to handling hitchhikers
	- the same firm limits you set for hitchhikers work beautifully for couch potatoes
- Conclusions
	- people are often unaware of how easily they can be manipulated to do another person's work
	- self-awareness of how some forms of altruistic behavior can be taken advantage of can substantially improve team efficiency and workload distribution
