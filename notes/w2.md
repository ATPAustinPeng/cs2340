# **[CS 2340] - Week 2: Test Driven Development (TDD), Requirements, & Domain Models**
## Test Driven Development (TDD)
### Software Is Buggy!
- on average, 1-5 bugs per 1 KLOC
- Windows
	- 35 MLOC
	- 2 bugs every 1000 lines

### Failure, Fault, Error
- **failure**: observable incorrect behavior of a program; conceptually related to the behavior of the program
- **fault (bug)**: related to the code; necessary (not sufficient) for the code
- **error**: cause of a fault; usually a human error (conceptual, type, etc.)

### Approaches To Verification
- **testing**: exercising software to try and generate failures
- **static verification**: identity specific problems statically (considering all possible executions)
- **inspection/review/walkthrough**: systematic group review of program text to detect faults
- **formal proof**: proving that the program text implements the program specification

### What Is Testing?
- **testing**: to execute a program with a sample of the input data
	- a dynamic technique and optimistic approximation

### Testing Granularity Levels
![[../img/w2-ss1-testing-granularity-levels-1.png|500]]

- **acceptance testing**: sign contract with the user
- regression testing
- developers' testing
- **alpha testing**: testing within the same organization; hopefully iron out all major bugs, QA team inside company, real clients (internal users of the software)
- **beta testing**: inquire 3rd party testers, fix additional bugs

### What Is TDD?
- test is written before the class to be tested and the developer writes unit testing code for nearly all production code
- write test code (code that fulfills requirements)
- write functional code (working code that fulfills requirements)
- refactor (clean working code that fulfills requirements)

### Why TDD?
- imposes developers' discipline
- provides incremental specification
- avoid regression errors
- allows for changing with confidence

### Structure Of Tests
- set fixture
- invoke
- check
- cleanup

## Requirements
### Introduction To Requirements
- **requirements**: system capabilities and conditions to which the system must conform
- functional requirements
	- features and capabilities
	- recorded in the Use Case Model
- non-functional (quality requirements)
	- usability (help, documentation, etc)
	- reliability (frequency of failure, recoverability, etc)
	- performance (response times, availability, etc)
	- supportability (adaptability, maintainability, etc)
	- recorded in the Use Case Model or in the Supplementary Specifications artifact
- the nature of UP supports changing requirements

### How Are Requirements Organized In UP Artifacts
- use case model
	- a set of typical scenario of using a system
	- primarily for functional requirements
- supplementary specification
	- everything not in the use cases
	- primarily for non-functional requirements
- glossary (noteworthy terms)
- vision
	- high-level requirements from the use case model and Supplementary Specification
- business rules (domain rules)
	- ex. government tax laws

### Where Do Requirements Come From?
- stakeholders
- application domain
- documentation

### Elicitation Problems
- thin spread of the domain knowledge
- knowledge is tacit
- limited observability
- bias

### Traditional Techniques
- background reading
- hard data and samples
- interviews
- surveys
- meetings

### Analyzing Requirements
- verification
- validation
- risk analysis

### Requirements, Verification, And Validation
- requirements validation
	- check that the right product is being built
	- ensures that the software being developed (or changed) will satisfy its stakeholders
	- checks the software requirements specification against stakeholdersâ€™ goals and requirements
- requirements verification
	- check that product is being built right
	- ensures that each step followed in the process of building the software yields the right products
	- checks consistency of the software requirements specification artifacts and other software development products (design, implementation, etc) against the specification

### The World And The Machine
- **validation question**: if the domain-to-be (excluding the system-to-be) has the properties D, and the system-to-be has the properties S, then the requirements R will be satisfied
	- D and S => R
- **verification question**: if the hardware has the properties H, and the software has the properties P, then the system requirements S will be satisfied
	- D and C and P => R

## Domain Models
### What Is A Domain Model?
- **domain model**: a visual representation of conceptual classes or real-situation objects in a domain
	- does not show software classes
	- software artifacts, responsibilities, or methods are not suitable in a domain model
- a domain model may show
	- domain objects or conceptual classes
	- associations between conceptual classes
	- attributes of conceptual classes
- **conceptual classes**: has a symbol, inclusion, and extension

### How To Create A Domain Model
1. find the conceptual classes
2. draw them as classes in a UML diagram
3. add associations and attributes

### Strategies For Finding Conceptual Classes
- reuse or modify existing models
- use a category list
- identify noun phrases

### Using Noun Phrase Identification
- identify nouns and noun phrases and consider them as candidate conceptual classes or attributes
- however, be careful...
	- mechanical noun-to-class mapping is not possible
	- words may be ambiguous

### Attributes vs. Classes
- if we do not think of some conceptual class X as a number or text in the real world, X is probably a conceptual class

### Description Classes
- **description class**: contains information that describes something else
- add description classes when:
	- there needs to be a description about an item or service, independent of the current existence of any examples of those items or services
	- deleting instances of items they describe, resulting in a loss of information that needs to be maintained
	- reduces redundant information

### Association
- **association**: relationships between classes that indicates some meaningful connection
- name an association based on \<ClassName\>-\<VerbPhrase\>-\<ClassName\> format
	- ex. Sale Paid-by CashPayment

![[../img/w2-ss6-association-class.png|400]]

### Roles and Multiplicity
- each end of an association is called a role
- roles may have
	- multiplicity expression
	- name
	- navigability

![[../img/w2-ss7-roles-and-multiplicity.png|400]]

### Attributes
- **attribute**: a logical data value of an object
	- are shown in the second compartment of the class box
- include attributes that the requirements suggest or imply a need to remember information
