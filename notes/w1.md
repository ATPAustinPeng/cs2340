# **[CS 2340] - Week 1: Introduction, Iterative Development & Unified Process**
## Introduction
### Why object-oriented approach? Why do we use objects?
- object-oriented analysis (OOA) has an emphasis on finding and describing objects in the problem domain
- object-oriented design (OOD) has an emphasis on defining software objects and their interaction to fulfill the requirements
- low representation gap (using similar templates for each object)

### The Need For Software Blueprints
- knowing an object-oriented language and having access to a library is necessary but not sufficient to create object software
- in between a nice idea and working software, there is much more than programming
- analysis and design provide software "blueprints", illustrated by a modeling language, like the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
	- blueprints serve as a tool for thought and as a form of communication with others

### Object-Oriented Analysis
- an investigation of the problem (rather than how a solution is defined)
- emphasis placed on finding and describing objects in the problem domain?
	- ex. concepts in an ATM system include a Bank and a Transaction

### Object-Oriented Design
- emphasis on a conceptual solution that fulfills the requirements
- needs to define software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill the requirements
	- ex. in the ATM System, a Transaction software object may have transactionID attribute and getTimestamp method
- designs are implemented in a programming language
	- ex. the Transaction class is made with Java

## Iterative Development
### The Unified Process (UP)
- **process**: a set of partially ordered steps intended to reach a goal
- in software engineering, the goal is to efficiently and predictably deliver a software product that meets the needs of your business
- **software development process**: an approach to building, deploying, and maintaining software
- for simple systems, it may be feasible to sequentially design the entire problem
- for complex systems, the linear approach is not realistic
- **Unified Process (UP)**: a process for building object-oriented systems
	- the goal is to enable the production of high-quality software that meets users needs within predictable schedules and budgets
	- promotes iterative development
- **iterative development**: the life of a system stretching over a series of cycles, each resulting in a product release

### Iterative Development
- **iterations**: development organized into a series of short fixed-length mini-projects; represents a complete development cycle (includes requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and testing)
	- outcome of each iteration is a tested, integrated, and executable system
- an iteration represents a complete development cycle including its treatment of requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and testing activities
- the iterative lifecycle is based on the successive enlargement and refinement of a system through multiple iterations with feedback and adaptation
- multiple iterations allows the system to grow incrementally over time
- the system may not be eligible for production deployment until after many iterations
- the output of each iteration is not an experimental prototype but a production subset of the final system
- each iteration tackles new requirements and incrementally extends the system
- an iteration may occasionally revisit existing software and improve it

### Embracing Change
- stakeholders usually have changing requirements
- each iteration involves choosing a small subset of requirements and quickly designing, implementing, and testing them
- this leads to rapid feedback, and an opportunity to modify or adapt understanding of the requirements or design

### Iteration Length And Timeboxing
- UP recommends short iteration lengths to allow for rapid feedback and adaptation
- long iterations increase project risk
- iterations are fixed in length (timeboxed)
	- if a meeting deadline seems to be difficult, then tasks or requirements are removed from the current iteration and pushed to a future iteration
- UP recommends an iteration be between 2 to 6 weeks

### Phases Of The Unified Process
1. **inception**: define the scope of the project
2. **elaboration**: plan project, specify features, baseline architecture
3. **construction**: build the project
4. **transition**: transition the product into the end-user community

### Iterations And Milestones
- each phase and iteration has some risk mitigation focus and concludes with a well-defined milestone
- the milestone review provides a point in time to assess how well key goals have been met and whether the project needs to be restructured in any way to proceed
- the end of each iteration is a minor release, a stable executable subset of the final product

### UP Disciplines
- an iteration includes work from most disciplines but the emphasis on each change in the phase
	- early iterations focus more on requirements and design (than later iterations)

### Disciplines And Phases
- although an iteration includes work in most disciplines, the relative effort and emphasis change over time
	- early iterations tend to apply greater emphasis to requirements and design
- Note: many activities and artifacts are optional but some UP practices and principles are invariant including:
	- iterative and risk-driven development
	- continuous verification of quality

### Advantages Of An Iterative Process
- reduces risk
	- risks are identified early, progress is easier to see
- get a robust architecture
	- architecture can be assessed and improved early
- handle evolving requirements
	- users provide feedback to operational systems
	- responding to feedback is an incremental change
- allow for changes
	- system can adapt to problems
- attain early learning
	- everyone obtains an understanding of the different workflows early on

## Unified Process
### Inception
- questions to ask
	- what is the vision and business case for the project?
	- is it feasible?
	- buy or build?
	- what is the cost estimate?
	- should we proceed or stop?
- the intent is to establish an initial common vision for the objectives of the project, determine if it is feasible and decide if it is worth some serious investigation in the elaboration phase

#### Artifacts That May Start In Inception
- vision and business case (describes high-level goals and constraints)
- use case model (describes functional requirements and related non-functional requirements)
- supplementary specification (describes other requirements)
- glossary(key-domain terminology)
- risk list and risk management plan (describes business, technical, resource, and schedule risks and ideas for their mitigation or response)
- prototype/proof-of-concept
- iteration plan (describes what to do in the first elaboration iteration)
- phase plan & software development plan (guess for elaboration phase duration; tools, people, education, and other resources)
- development case (description of the customized UP steps and artifacts for this project)
- artifacts will be partially completed in this phase and refined in later iterations

#### Use Case Types And Format
- black-box use cases describe system responsibilities (ex. define what the system must do)
- use cases may be written in three formality types
	- brief: one paragraph summary (usually main success scenario)
	- casual: informal paragraph
	- fully dressed: elaborate; all steps and variations are written in detail

#### Use Case Diagrams
![[../img/w1-ss3-use-case-model.png|500]]

#### What Happened In Inception?
- a short (~1 week) requirements workshop
- most actors, goals, and use cases named
- most use cases are written in brief format (10-20% of the use cases are written in full detail to improve understanding of the scope and complexity)
- most influential and risky quality requirements identified
- proof-of-concept prototypes were developed
- plan for the first iteration

### On To Elaboration
- during elaboration
	- core and risky software is programmed and tested
	- majority of requirements are discovered and stabilized
	- major risks are mitigated or resolved
- best practices
	- do short timeboxed risk-driven iterations
	- start programming early
	- adaptively design, implement, and test the core and risky parts of the architecture
	- test early, often, and realistically
	- adapt based on feedback from tests, users, and developers
	- write most of the use cases and other requirements in detail

#### Iteration 1 Requirements
- emphasis on fundamental issues, requirements analysis, and OOA/OOD
- implement a basic key scenario of the use case (only short and simple use cases are completed in iteration 1)
	- ex. for a Process Sale use case, implement entering items and receiving payment
- no collaboration with external devices
	- ex for a Process Sale use case, no using a tax calculator or product database
- subsequent iterations will grow on this foundation

#### System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
- **sequence diagram**: a picture that shows for a particular scenario of a use case, the events that external actors generate, their order, and possible inner-system events
- all systems are treated as a black box
- the diagram emphasizes events that cross the system boundary from actors to systems

![[../img/w1-ss4-system-sequence-diagram.png|500]]

#### Domain Model
- **domain model**: illustrates meaningful concepts in a problem domain
	- is a representation of real-world things, not software components
	- is a set of static structure diagrams, no operations are defined
- it may show
	- concepts
	- associations between concepts
	- attributes of concepts
- **concept**: an idea, thing, or object

![[../img/w1-ss5-domain-model.png|200]]

#### Design Class Diagram (DCD)
- DCD shows software entities while Domain Models show real-world entities

#### Iteration 1 Result
- all software is rigorously tested
- customers feedback is obtained
- the system has been integrated and stabilized

#### Iteration 2 Requirements
- emphasis on object design
- support for variations in third-party external services
	- ex. for the Process Sale, include complex pricing rules or design a GUI

#### Iteration 3 Requirements
- emphasis on a variety of analysis and design

#### Construction And Transition Phases
- elaboration phase -> understand most requirements
	- builds risky and architecturally significant core of the system
- construction -> build the remaining requirements
	- conduct alpha testing (developer side testing)
	- ends when system is ready for operational deployment
- transition phase -> putting system into production use
	- conduct beta testing (client-side testing)

### Comments On Iterative Development And Unified Process
#### Additional Unified Process Best Practices And Concepts
- central idea of UP -> short timeboxed iterative, adaptive development
- tackle high-risk and high-value issues in early iterations
- continuously engage users (at every iteration)
- early iterations focus on core architecture
- continuously verify quality
- carefully manage requirements

#### Problems With The Waterfall Lifecycle
- tackles high-risk or difficult problems late
- assumes requirements are fully specified and doesn't change
- design of the system is inflexible
- dictates that architecture is fully specified once requirements are completed
