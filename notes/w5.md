# **[CS 2340] - Week 5: Sequence Robustness & Design Classes**
## Sequence Robustness
### Robustness Diagram
- bridges the "what/how" gap from:
	- use case model -> code

![[../img/w5-ss1-robustness-diagram.png|500]]

### Drawing Robustness Diagrams
#### Robustness Diagram Notation
![[../img/w5-ss2-robustness-diagram-notation.png|250]]

#### Robustness Diagram Rules
![[../img/w5-ss3-robustness-diagram-rule.png|400]]

- nouns can talk to verbs, verbs can talk to nouns
- nouns can't talk to other nouns
- verbs can talk to other verbs

#### Valid Relationship Example
![[../img/w5-ss4-valid-relationship-ex.png|450]]

- an actor can talk to a boundary object
- boundary objects and controllers can talk to each other (noun <-> verb)
- a controller can talk to another controller (verb <-> verb)
- controllers and entity objects can talk to each other (verb <-> noun)

#### Invalid Relationship Example
![[../img/w5-ss5-invalid-relationship-ex.png|450]]

- an actor can't talk directly to a controller or entity (must talk to a boundary object)
- boundary objects and entity objects can't talk directly to each other (must go through a controller)
- entities can't talk directly to other entities (must go through a controller)
- boundary objects can't talk directly to other boundary objects (must go through a controller)

### Robustness Analysis Guidelines
- paste the use case text directly onto your robustness diagram
- take your entity classes from the domain model and add any that are missing
- expect to rewrite (disambiguate) your use case while drawing the robustness diagram
- make a boundary object for each screen and name your screens unambiguously
- remember that controllers are only occasionally real controller objects
	- they are more typically logical software functions
- don't worry about the direction of the arrows on a robustness diagram
- it is okay to drag and use case onto a robustness diagram
- boundary and entity classes on a robustness diagram will generally become object instances on a sequence diagram, while controllers will become messages
- remember that robustness diagram is an "object picture" of a use case, whose purpose is to force refinement of both use case text and the object model

## Design Classes
### Object-Oriented Design
- emphasizes a conceptual solution that fulfills the requirements
- need to define software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill the requirements
	- ex. in the Library Information System, a *Book* software object may have a *title* attribute and a *getChapter* method
- designs are implemented in a programming language
	- ex. we will have a *Book* class in Java.

### From Design To Implementation
![[../img/w5-ss6-design-to-implementation.png|450]]

### Creating Design Class Diagrams
#### When To Create DCDs
- once the interaction diagrams have been completed it is possible to identify the specification for the software classes and interfaces
- a class diagram differs from a Domain Model by showing software entities rather than real-world concepts
- the UML has notation to define design details in static structure, or class diagrams.

#### Definition: Design Class Diagram
![[../img/w5-ss7-design-class-diagram.png|450]]

#### Class Attributes
- full format:
	- visibility name : type multiplicity = default {property-string}
- visibility marks: + (public), -(private), # (protected)
- attributes assumed private if no visibility is given
- operations assumed public if no visibility is given

#### Attribute Text vs. Association Line Notation For An Attribute
![[../img/w5-ss8-attribute-text-vs-association-line.png|450]]

#### Idioms In Association Notation Usage In Different Perspectives
![[../img/w5-ss9-idioms-in-association-notation.png|450]]

#### When to Use Attribute Text vs. Association Lines for Attributes
- guideline:
	- use the attribute text notation for data type objects
	- use the association line notation for others
- common data types: 
	- Boolean, Date, Number, Character, String (Text), SSN, ZIP, Phone #, etc.

#### The UML Notation For An Association End
![[../img/w5-ss12-uml-notation-for-association.png|400]]

#### Note Symbols
-   a note symbol may represent several things
	-   UML note or comment
	-   UML constraint
	-   method body

![[../img/w5-ss13-note-symbols.png|500]]

#### Operations and Methods
- operation syntax, UML1:
	- visibility name (parameter-list) : return-type {property-string}
- operations are usually assumed public if no visibility is shown
- operations to access attributes are often excluded

#### UML Keywords
![[../img/w5-ss14-uml-keywords.png|500]]

#### Dependency
- you want low-coupling across classes because it allows for easier refactoring when dependencies change (if you touch something in one class, it doesn't greatly affect the other class)

![[../img/w5-ss15-dependency.png|350]]

#### Optional Dependency Labels

![[../img/w5-ss16-optional-dependency-label.png|600]]

#### Interfaces

![[../img/w5-ss17-interfaces.png|350]]

#### Inheritance

![[../img/w5-ss18-inheritance-1.png|350]]
![[../img/w5-ss19-inheritance-2.png|350]]

#### Abstract Class
![[../img/w5-ss20-abstract-class.png|350]]

#### Composition Over Abstraction
- **aggregation**: “has-part” association relationship; hollow diamond shape

![[../img/w5-ss21-aggregation.png|400]]

- **composition**: whole-part association relationship; filled diamond shape

![[../img/w5-ss22-composition.png|550]]

#### Constraints
![[../img/w5-ss23-constraints.png|400]]

#### Utility Class
![[../img/w5-ss24-utility.png|200]]
- the {leaf} notation means that this class can have no children

#### Association Class
- many to many relationship
