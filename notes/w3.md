# **[CS 2340] - Week 3: Use Cases & SSD**
## Use Cases
### Definitions
- **use cases**: text stories used to discover and record requirements
- **actor**: something with behavior, such as a person, computer system, or organization
- **scenario**: specific sequence of actions and interactions between actors and the system under discussion
- **use case**: a collection of related success and failure scenarios that describe actors using a system to support a goal

### Use Case Modeling
- use case model is defined within the requirements discipline in UP
- use case model is a set of all written use cases
- use case model may optionally include a use case diagram

### Use Cases And Adding Value
- a key point is to focus on the question "how can using the system provide observable value to the use, or fulfill their goals?"
- use cases mainly constitute functional requirements

### 3 Kinds Of Actors
- primary actor
	- has user goals fulfilled through using service of the system under design (SuD)
- supporting actor 
	- provides a service (ex. information) to the SuD
- offstage actor
	- has an interest in the behavior of the use case

### Goals And Scope Of A Use Case
- focus on use cases at the level of elementary business process

### Finding Primary Actors, Goals, And Use Cases
- choose the system boundary
- identify primary actors (those that have user goals fulfilled through using services of the system)
- for each actor identify their user goals
- define use cases that satisfy user goals and name them according to their goal
	- EPB test, boss test, size test

### Determining Validity Of Use Cases
- **elementary business process (EBP)**: a task performed by one person in one place at one time which adds measurable business value and leaves the data in a consistent state
	- ex. approve credit order -> CORRECT
	- ex. negotiate a supplier contract -> INCORRECT
- **boss test**: what have you been doing all day
- **size test**: use typically contains many steps as opposed to a single step within a series of steps

### Essential vs. Concrete Style
- essential -> focus is on intent
	- avoids making UI decisions
- concrete -> UI decisions are embedded in the use case text
	- ex. admin enters ID and password in the dialog box (see picture X)
	- not suitable during early requirements analysis work

## SSD
### System Behavior And System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
- **sequence diagram**: a picture that shows (for a particular scenario of a use case), the events that external actors generate, their order, and possible inter-system events
- all systems are treated as a black box
- the diagram places emphasis on events that cross the system boundary from actors to systems

### SSD Example

### Naming System Events And Operations
- the set of all required system operations is determined by identifying the system events
	- ex. makeNewSale(), addLineItem(itemID, quantity), endSale()

### Sequence Diagrams: Fragments
- manage complex interactions with sequence fragments
	- loop -> iteration
	- alt -> alterations
	- opt -> option
	- ref -> reference

#### Loop
![[../img/w3-ss3-sequence-fragment-loop.png|200]]
- calls notify() 10 times

#### Alternatives
![[../img/w3-ss4-sequence-fragment-alternative.png|200]]
- calls accept() if balance > 0
- calls reject() otherwise

#### Option
![[../img/w3-ss5-sequence-fragment-option.png|200]]
- post comments if there were no errors

#### Reference
![[../img/w3-ss6-sequence-fragment-reference.png|200]]
- Web customer and Bookshop use (reference) interaction Checkout

### SSDs Within The Unified Process
- SSDs are not usually motivated in inception
- most SSDs are created during elaboration
